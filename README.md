# Under-Five-Mortality-Rate
Capstone project for my Master's degree. Completed by Divya Alukal.

This is the code pertaining to the capstone project of my Master's degree, in which I used demographic, social and health data from the 2012-2013 round of India's Annual Health Survey to create a predictive model for the Under-Five Mortality Rate (U5MR) in nine Indian states. The file Explanatory [should be Exploratory] Data Analysis - U5MR shows how I prepared the dataset. The file Modelling - U5MR shows model development. The original dataset is also available for viewing in Key_indicator_districtwise.

The data used were posted by Rajanand Ilangovan on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajanand/key-indicators-of-annual-health-survey?resource=download and were initially published by the Government of India at https://data.gov.in/catalog/indicators-annual-health-survey. My code draws in part upon a project shared by Yassine Ghouzam at https://www.kaggle.com/code/yassineghouzam/titanic-top-4-with-ensemble-modeling/notebook.
